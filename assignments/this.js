/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.

* 3. In new binding, using "new" we create an instance of the object with new.
* 4. Explicit binding is used to call an object method with another object as an argument.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
